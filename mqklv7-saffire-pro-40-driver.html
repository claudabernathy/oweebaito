                            <p>График работы в праздничные дни! 29 - 12 - 2018 29 декабря 2018 г. - короткий рабочий день (до 16.00 часов). I see a lot of "So I've been uploading for a week now." kind of comments and would like to extend some friendly help. What I am getting at is you can watch a video at 480p with clean audio and be fine. As soon as you have bad/clipping/low quality commentary audio it becomes unbearable. amp#x200B; Most gameplay recorders will take whatever your default audio driver output is, 44.1khz at 16bit. This is CD quality. If possible, in Windows sound settings increase that to, atleast, 48khz I haven't had a chance to play around much with home recording for 8-10 years but I've gotten the itch again. I ended up on eBay on one of those "I hope my wife doesn't ask how much this shit costs" binges. I've had a Kurzweil PC3 hooked into a Focusrite Saffire Pro 40 for a good, long while. I added a Roland Integra 7, a Korg Triton Rack, and an Ensoniq ZR-76. The ZR doesn't factor into the issues I'm having because it has analog outs only. When I first got the Pro 40 there # Preface Sorry for the walls of text, but I feel like I need to type this out in order to keep track of the whole thing mentally. Move on if you have something better to do, but if you’re interested, here it is: amp#x200B; # Background After over a year of tinkering and various hardware/software installations, I had a rock solid dual-boot macOS 10.12/Windows 10 build for Audio/Photo/Graphic/Video work. It had a custom DSDT/SSDT, a super clean custom Clover theme, working iMessage/AirDrop/. Hi all, I am a podcast producer working with clients who are starting to do more remote interviews. I generally have my hosts using a dynamic mic plugged into an audio interface, however I've had mixed results getting Zencastr to recognize the input from the interface. One client was able to use his Steinberg UR44 successfully, but I wasn't able to get Zencastr to recognize a Focusrite Saffire Pro 40 in another case. I can select the Saffire as the input, I get signal from the mic (as indicate. So I have this thing: Which has an optical Toslink spdif connection, and the Saffire Pro 40 which I believe only has electrical spdif and optical adat. I've recorded with both with their respective drivers and the clocks drift by about 10ms every minute. :/ Is there a way I could possibly clock sync with an optical cable between the two? I'll try to get them to cooperate with asio4all today, but I don't think there's a way. One is PCI and the other. Since the Fall Creator Update my Saffire Pro 40 has started acting up: Everything boots normally, audio works fine, but after some time (seemingly random) the audio stops. If on YouTube video, the video stops. Spotify will also say that it cannot play songs. I check the audio properties for the device and I find the sample rate has changed (each time to a random value). To temporarily fix it, I either change the sample rate again (strangely changing it to ANYTHING will make it work again). My computer crashes every other day. It just randomly shuts down and then it pops up with a screen saying your computer has restarted due to an error - please press any key to continue. Here is the error report after the computer restarts: Tue Oct 17 18:49:42 2017 Panic Report panic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff802398a611): Kernel trap at 0xffffff7fa46a269c, type 13=general protection, registers: CR0: 0x000000008001003b, CR2: 0x0000000109eb8000, CR3: 0x0000000027d5a000 
I've spent the past few hours assembling and configuring everything for my first hackintosh with no shortage of hangups. Thus far, these are the ones I can't seem to get past: It took me a little while to get the Web Driver for the 980 to work, I tried the default Mac Pro 3,1 SMBIOS with the 346.03.15f01, and the 346.03.15f02 driver(s), neither worked (I had nvda_drv=1 set). I tried the iMac 14,2 SMBIOS with the 346.03.25b01 driver and now the GPU seems to be working. Upon initial setup I just got Komplete about 2 months ago and while I'm in love with Reaktor, it continues to cut the audio out and crackle when it is armed or monitored. I'm having trouble finding where this bottle neck is happening. My computer is a fully loaded iMac from December 2016: - 4.0 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 - 16GB 1867MHz DDR3 SDRAM - 512GB Flash Storage - AMD Radeon R9 M395 with 2GB video memory I am running Cubase 8.5 and Reaktor 6 when this happens. It happens through several differe. Research and reviews seem to say that the Saffire Pro 40 is a better, more reliable product than Focusrite's USB option. However, we're in a Thunderbolt era now (but the Focusrite Clarett is out of my budget). Is the firewire Saffire still a good idea to purchase now in 2016? I would want this interface to last as long as my macbook, ideally. I need to have 8 mic inputs for recording, and separately need up to 8 analog outputs for live output from Mainstage. Both of these products. I realize that this sub is more geared toward advanced sound engineering, but I figured I'd throw this here in case someone with a lot of knowledge has any first hand experience with this. I'm not asking for "what to buy," this is specifically for feedback on this particular interface. I just built a new PC and I was looking to do some recording here and there. Nothing crazy right now, just electric and acoustic guitar tracks and some vocals (1 or 2 channels at a time). Don't plan on running. I just built a new PC and I was looking to do some recording here and there. Nothing crazy right now, just electric and acoustic guitar tracks and some vocals (1 or 2 channels at a time). Don't plan on running a ton of VSTs. My price range is 0-0. I came across the Saffire Pro 24 and it looked like a pretty solid interface. There were quite a few bad reviews early on (2010-2011) about the drivers not playing nice with Windows 7, so I'd like some feedback on whether or not that's. Specs: i7-3770K GTX 760 GA-Z77X-UP5 10.10.3 Saffire Pro 40 Hello everyone, I've been trying to troubleshoot an issue and I think I have found the root of the problem. I'm using a GTX 760 and I updated some drivers this week. After I did all of these updates, I started to get hung up on iobluetoothhcicontroller searchfortransporteventtimeouthandler in verbose mode, which is related to graphics card issues-- although everything I've seen seems to indicate that these don't affect my specific. 
Posted yesterday with not much luck, Clover is over my head at the moment and really need to get this machine up and running before the weekend. I've read in a few places that people with this issue were able to put Chimera 1.4.1 and get around this issue. It seems to be with the driver the Saffier Mixcontrol installs? I can boot fine with Uni/Multibeast setup but after I try to install So I'll keep this as simple as possible. So my current setup is: PC gt (Firewire) Focusrite Saffire Pro 40 (Headphone OUT) gt IEMs I'm picking up a pair of K702s very soon. I'm thinking about picking up a Schiit Magni/Modi because I feel like the Saffire Pro 40 won't be enough to drive my K702s. I'm thinking about: PC gt (Firewire) Focusrite Saffire Pro 40 (Optical OUT) gt Magni/Modi gt K702s. Is this an optimal setup, or should I be looking to set this up differently? I'm looking to build a hackintosh to run Logic Pro X and MainStage for audio production. I want to run my mics and instruments through a Focusrite Saffire Pro 40 audio interface which connects with firewire 800 and supports thunderbolt when using an adapter. My question is what type of firewire card or drivers will I need to get the two to work together or will the audio interface work "out-of-the-box?" This is my first time building a hackintosh so I'm not really Hi guys! Purchased the Focusrite Saffire about 2 weeks ago, Runs fantastic on 44.1 and 48 sample rate. Once I try to open anything with a sample rate of 88.2, all hell breaks loose! ProTools dialog box appears saying: "Could not complete the Open Session. command because while translating Audio Engine Settings" and then stops working with the interface and in worse cases, crashes Tools. Any ideas guys? Thanks in advance! System: Windows 7 (64bit) Focusrite Saffire Pro 40 (All drivers. Hey, I have a Saffire Pro 40 and on top of recording I want to use it as general sound output for my Windows 7 PC. Got the drivers installed fine but I'm struggling to find a way to get the audio from Windows to come through on my monitors. Two monitors are plugged into line out 1 and 2 on the back of the unit (these are labelled 'Monitors' so assuming I've got these in the right place) I have selected the Saffire 'Speakers' output within the Windows 7 'Playback' dialogue but not sure where. So I got a new interface for christmas it is a saffire pro 40 and I do not have have a firewire port on my macbook for which I use logic on. My dad gave me a USB adapter and its just not working. I installed all the drivers on the CD but it wont show up on devices or anything. Sometimes an alert pops up saying its disabling the usb device because its drawing too much power sometimes. Someone please. Hey WATTM! I had posted here about 3 months ago about buying an interface, and you guys were awesome, but I wasn't able to buy it then. Spent some time, did more research, and now that I'm actually about to buy it, I was hoping you could give me some guidance again! I'm looking for something with at least 8 xlr ins and preamps, and 8 trs outs to work with to record in a live rock setting (drums,guitars, bass, keys, vocals). I'd be running 8 mic inputs THROUGH the interface into a laptop Hello, I'd like to set up a virtual audio cable on my Windows 10 PC for streaming. If anyone can suggest programs/drivers that are compatible with my devices, please let me know. I want to be able to EQ my voice in an audio workstation program, so that the output of that EQ'ed audio will play through my stream, when selecting my microphone in OBS settings. My Gear: Large condenser microphone Scarlett Saffire Pro 40 (firewire interface) Windows 10 OBS Saffire Mix Control audio device. So I'm looking to get an audio interface to record me and my buddy's band, and we kind of have settled on the Focusrite Saffire Pro 40 ( At first we were thinking about getting the Tascam US-1800 ( as it's pretty cheap, but talking to a Sweetwater rep he explained that he isn't a fan of Tascam because they stop updating the drivers for products when they get older. Anyone have any experience worki. 
Update for anyone with the same issue: I installed ASIO4ALL and configured it for use with my interface. Very interesting that such a lightweight, free driver works better than what came with my interface. Hey Guys, I've been searching high and low but have been unable to fix this problem. I just got Ableton along with a Launchpad, which seems basically unusable. It takes quite a while for any notes to play upon pushing the pads down in User 1 mode, making it impossible to keep time at a stead. I am about to purchase a new firewire interface to work with my macbook pro and (mostly) Logic. I need the 8 pre amps provided by the focusrite saffire pro 40 and the Motu 8 Pre, but cannot decide. The focusrite has more i/o options and the analogue outs are a plus, but i've read mixed reviews about driver stability etc. Can anyone reassure me here? If the Motu was a much more stable and reliable option then i would be willing to sacrifice the extra i/o. Any opinions and experience Hello! This issue has begun in the past week since the latest Windows Update. It's extremely frustrating and I can't seem to Google-Fu a solution. Basically, all media seems to not want to work any more. For example; YouTube videos will play, but without audio (a few days ago it wouldn't play video either?) iTunes ( just doesn't play at all. The program doesn't freeze or anything, everything seems to work fine except no audio and no progress INTERFACCIA AUDIO 8 IN / 6 OUT FIREWIRE / THUNDERBOLT La Saffire Pro 14 la nostra interfaccia audio FireWire dal costo pi basso, ma che vanta sia un'incredibile.
